- Upgrade system just for fun
	- `sudo-apt get update`, `sudo apt-get upgrade`, `sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools`, AND `sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools`
		- the last line was required to prevent install of neotrellis library install from breaking due to pip problems
	- Warning: This will take FOREVER
- Enabled I2C and SPI, and installed CircuitPython libraries in Python3
	- source: https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi
	- Ran blinkatest.py to confirm
- Install Neotrellis library in Python3
	-`sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-neotrellis`
- Default audio interface set-up: Create file ~/.asoundrc
	````
	pcm.!default {
	        type hw
	        card 0
	        device 0
	}
	ctl.!default {
	        type hw
	        card 0
	        device 0
	}
	````
	- where 'card 0' is replaced by the device number when running 'aplay -l'. Then confirm it's working by running 'alsamixer'
- Installed cffi and JACK-Client using pip3
- Installed fluidsynth and qsynth using apt-get
- Installed a2jmidi using apt-get (for converting alsa-midi, which sooperlooper uses, to jack-midi)

---------

To do:

- [x] get sampler.py working
- [x] run 'cat /etc/os-release' to find out which raspbian I am using
- [x] try again after setting pygame init options
- [x] get midi commands being sent through jack
- [x] get midi_jack.py accepting button presses on trellis to send midi commands
- [ ] I had midi commands being sent to sooperlooper, but sooperlooper wasn't playing any audio. if I could just get everything working at the same time...!

Improving latency:

- [ ] use interrupt pin on the trellis (must solder male-female jumper to board, and plug in gpio #5 I think)
- [ ] use raspi-config to boot to command-line without GUI
- [ ] overclock cpu?
- [ ] install raspbian lite?
- [ ] find that jack script that disables unnecessary stuff
