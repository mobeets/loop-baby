- Upgrade system just for fun
	- `sudo-apt get update`, `sudo apt-get upgrade`, `sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools`, AND `sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools`
		- the last line was required to prevent install of neotrellis library install from breaking due to pip problems
	- Warning: This will take FOREVER
- Enabled I2C and SPI, and installed CircuitPython libraries in Python3
	- source: https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi
	- Ran blinkatest.py to confirm
- Install Neotrellis library in Python3
	-`sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-neotrellis`
- Default audio interface set-up: Create file ~/.asoundrc
	````
	pcm.!default {
	        type hw
	        card 0
	        device 0
	}
	ctl.!default {
	        type hw
	        card 0
	        device 0
	}
	````
	- where 'card 0' is replaced by the device number when running 'aplay -l'. Then confirm it's working by running 'alsamixer'
- Installed cffi and JACK-Client using pip3
- Installed fluidsynth and qsynth using apt-get
- Installed a2jmidi using apt-get (for converting alsa-midi, which sooperlooper uses, to jack-midi)
- pip3 install osc4py3

---------

Start-up:
1. /usr/bin/jackd -T -ndefault -R -d alsa &
2. qjackctl
3. sooperlooper via gui
4. python3 looper.py -v

Last time:
- jack wasn't recognizing audio in for a while, but after closing qjackctl and re-opening, eventually it worked
	- I also manually set Input (hw:Device,0, 'USB Audio') and Output (hw:Device, 'USB PnP Sound Device'), but not sure if that was necessary
- got loop-baby sending OSC messages: secret was setting "-o 127.0.0.1" which is now the default
- controlled sooperlooper using the loop-baby!

Logic issues:
- if a track is muted and then you record/overdub to it, should first unmute it
- settings to set sync options

Color issues:
- sometimes hitting pause triggers lots of mode buttons at once??
	- it's always a random release of buttons. so a hack solution would be to only count a release that has a registered press. so when we press, we make a tag, and when we release, we must find a matching tag, then clear the tag
- when recording/overdubbing, should show which tracks already have things recorded to (self.loops[0].has_had_something_recorded)
- can I set brightness of colors? to minimize bleed

Box issues:
- color appears to bleed less if buttons are lower set in case (you can see this by adding another button top plate)
- box slides around a lot

To do:

- [ ] test trellis control on pi
- [ ] add in auto-jack connect
- [ ] add in trellis control
- [ ] get everything running on boot
- [ ] add background script to check for restart cmd

Improving latency:

- [ ] use interrupt pin on the trellis (must solder male-female jumper to board, and plug in gpio #5 I think)
- [ ] use raspi-config to boot to command-line without GUI
- [ ] overclock cpu?
- [ ] install raspbian lite?
- [ ] find that jack script that disables unnecessary stuff
