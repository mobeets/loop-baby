Software
--------------

Do the following in order:

- Set up audio interface
	- plugged in iMic audio interface, which was automatically recognized
		- this both adds audio input capabilities to the pi, and gives what's potentially a better output as well
	- Made imic the default sound card in Preferences > Audio Settings
		- "sudo lsusb -v" to confirm name (hw: system)
	- Confirmed we can play out of speaker on the pi
		- Run "speaker-test" and brace yourself
	- Confirmed we can record audio on the pi
		- Using Audacity ("sudo apt-get install audacity")
- Install jackd
	- jackd came already installed
		- otherwise could run "sudo apt-get install jackd1"
- Install sooperlooper
	- "sudo apt-get install sooperlooper"
- Install qjackctrl (I think?)
	- "sudo apt-get install qt5-default"
	- downloaded qjackctrl online, then tried "./configure," and it broke
	- but then I tried running qjackctrl and it ran just fine, so either it was already installed or installed enough to work
- Start Jackd
	- jackd -R -d alsa -d hw:system -n myjack &
		- "-d alsa" sets driver to alsa
		- "-d hw:system" selects the iMic sound card ("aplay -l" gives names of valid devices)
		- might also add "-n 3" to set buffer periods to 3, or  "-r 44100", to set sample rate to 44.1 KHz
- Start Sooperlooper
	- sudo killall -q -9 -w sooperlooper
		- make sure there are no previous instances running
	- sudo sooperlooper -S myjack -j sooperlooper -p 9951 &
		- start sooperlooper connected to jack, and run on port 9951
	- or if that fails, just start the GUI
- Connect Sooperlooper to Jack (but failed)
	- while ! nc -4 -u -z -v localhost 9951; do sleep 1; done
		- wait until port is opened, otherwise we can't connect things
	- sudo jack_connect system:capture_1 sooperlooper:common_in_1
	- sudo jack_connect system:capture_2 sooperlooper:common_in_2
	- sudo jack_connect sooperlooper:common_out_2 system:playback_2
	- sudo jack_connect sooperlooper:common_out_1 system:playback_1
	- or if that fails, just open qjackctrl and connect graphically
- Record audio in sooperlooper!
	- Open Sooperlooper (the GUI)
	- Run "qjackctrl" and make connections with GUI
	- The end! (I had iphone playing radiohead in, then sampled parts and played it to speakers)

To-do:

- Cannot connect sooperlooper to jackd via command line
	- Running "sudo sooperlooper..." from cmd line opens a new instance of jackd that doesn't appear to use the ~/.jackdrc
	- Opening the sooperlooper gui _does_ use ~/.jackdrc but then it breaks an assert
	- Possible options:
		- Try running "slgui" with appropriate options and see if that works
		- Try changing options inside qjackctrl?
- Get this all starting up automatically on boot

Button commands
--------------

BUTTONS:
	1 2 3 4
	5 6 7 8
	A B C D
	E F G H
- A-H: Mode buttons
	- Audio modes (1-8 are track selections):
		- E: Play/pause
		- F: Record
		- G: Overdub
		- H: Mute
	- Option modes:
		- A: One-hit
		- B: Save/Recall (1-8 then become file locations)
		- C: Clear
		- D: Settings (e.g., quantize on/off, clock source, etc.)
- 1-8: Track buttons
	- when in one-hit mode, these trigger samples
	- when in record/overdub mode, these select the track you're recording to
	- when in save mode, these specify file locations to save to (and are lit up when file already exists here)
	- when in recall mode, these specify file locations to load (and only lit up options are allowed)

Other possible modes:
- Clear track (could just be the result of pressing record+track and not a separate button)

General behavior:
- One button for each track.
- When in play mode, each track plays on loop unless muted.
- When in pause mode, tracks can be played like samples.

Mode buttons:
- One button to set record/overdub (light changes to signify which)
	- when in record mode, long-press or (double-tap?) a track button to clear it. or maybe hold the record/overdub button and the track button simultaneously to clear it
- One button to set mute mode
- One button for play/pause

- Use Sooperlooper as one-shot sampler
	- when in mute mode, hits "oneshot", which plays sample once from the top and then goes back to mute

Midi in (for clock)
--------------
Goal: Receive midi clock from a midi jack, and use it to sync the sooperlooper's loop length

Plan:
- build a midi minijack input
	- parts/circuits: http://www.notesandvolts.com/2015/02/midi-and-arduino-build-midi-input.html
	- only replace the 5-pin midi with just a single 3.5mm minijack following the instructions here:
		- http://cdm.link/2015/08/used-stereo-minijack-cables-midi/
		- this will make it compatible with beatstep's clock out
- read the clock messages using serial in on the pi
	- https://www.instructables.com/id/PiMiDi-A-Raspberry-Pi-Midi-Box-or-How-I-Learned-to/

Options:
- usb-midi adapter -- but do not buy cheap ones! they can ruin devices...
- build your own pi-midi adapter
	- https://www.instructables.com/id/PiMiDi-A-Raspberry-Pi-Midi-Box-or-How-I-Learned-to/
- midi in with gpio
	- http://www.samplerbox.org/article/midiinwithrpi
- 3.5mm female connected to gpio
	- to come straight in from beatstep pro's clock out
	- to connect midi, just use those 3.5mm-midi adapters
	- apparently it's just a square wave clock signal (e.g., one pulse per step, or 24 pulses per quarter note, etc.)

How to use with sooperlooper:
- "Set 'sync to' to Jack/Host; Go into SL settings and tick the box 'Round tempo to integer values on record'"
	- http://essej.net/slforum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=4921

	- https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/midi-tutorial/all#hardware--electronic-implementation

	- https://www.arturia.com/faq/beatsteppro/beatstep-pro-general-questions
- reading midi clock from beatstep (via usb...)
	- https://github.com/rupa/octoeuclid/blob/master/euclid/beatsteppro.py
- more detail on clock out in beatstep pro manual
	- http://downloads.arturia.net/products/beatstep-pro/manual/BeatStepPro_Manual_1_4_0_EN.pdf
- description of beatstep pro's clock out
	- "...is not a MIDI clock. It's basically a square wave signal that can be used to sync devices that have an analog clock input"
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/5okhxw/midi_clock_out_issues_beatstep_pro/

To do: when clock comes from the beatstep, what format is it? midi is apparently serial, so this is likely similar. so maybe as a starting point, I could try to read that data in. If that's possible, it should be possible to simply connect a minijack straight into the gpio, and read it in.

Case
--------------

Current plan for buttons: Get a 4x4 Adafruit button/multi-color-led grid and use their trellis library to connect to a raspberri pi.
- 4x4 led grid ($13)
	- https://www.adafruit.com/product/3954
	- https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neotrellis?view=all
- 4x4 silicon buttons ($5)
	- http://www.adafruit.com/product/1611
- stemma cable? ($1)
	- http://www.adafruit.com/product/3568
- bumper feet ($1)
	- https://www.adafruit.com/product/550

Optional:
- pi cobbler ($7), for connecting things to pi solderlessly
	- https://www.adafruit.com/product/914

- https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/14035/8x8-matrix-of-buttons
- https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/4749/controlling-many-leds-with-few-gpio-pins
- maybe look for people making monomes with a raspberry pi
- The adafruit trellis library would work, but then leds could not be multi-colored (RGB), as far as I can tell

Current plan: 4x4 grid, or two 2x2 grids
- silicon buttons ($4-5) [adafruit or sparkfun]
- pcb driver for buttons ($13) [adafruit or sparkfun]
	- though make sure these are compatible with rgb leds!
		- adafruit's more expensive one is!
	- sparkfun's is just a board, where as adafruit's has a library
	- actually the adafruit one comes with 16 neopixel leds already soldered in!
- top and bottom bezels for buttons ($12) [sparkfun]
	- these are maybe not necessary (and apparently not the best quality)
- rgb leds ($1/led) [adafruit]

Installs
--------------

an incomplete list of things I did:

- Upgrade system just for fun
	- `sudo-apt get update`, `sudo apt-get upgrade`, `sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools`, AND `sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools`
		- the last line was required to prevent install of neotrellis library install from breaking due to pip problems
	- Warning: This will take FOREVER
- Enabled I2C and SPI, and installed CircuitPython libraries in Python3
	- [source](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi)
	- Run blinkatest.py to confirm
- Install Neotrellis library in Python3
	- `sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-neotrellis`
- Default audio interface set-up: Create file ~/.asoundrc
	````
	pcm.!default {
	        type hw
	        card 0
	        device 0
	}
	ctl.!default {
	        type hw
	        card 0
	        device 0
	}
	````
	- where 'card 0' is replaced by the device number when running 'aplay -l'. Then confirm it's working by running 'alsamixer'
- Installed cffi and JACK-Client using pip3
- Installed fluidsynth and qsynth using apt-get
- Installed a2jmidi using apt-get (for converting alsa-midi, which sooperlooper uses, to jack-midi)
- pip3 install osc4py3

Notes
--------------

Requirements:
- [Jack](http://jackaudio.org/)
- [SooperLooper](http://essej.net/sooperlooper/index.html)

References:
- Real-time Rasbian [distro](https://guysoft.wordpress.com/2017/10/09/realtimepi/): might be useful for reducing latency, if that's an issue.
- SooperLooper getting started [video](https://vimeo.com/7315051)
- [Someone](https://github.com/colinbrogan) working on similar thing
- SooperLooper [forum](http://essej.net/slforum/viewforum.php?f=4)
- Startup/shutdown scripts: https://github.com/vixus0/loopi
- [Loopcenter](http://loopcenter.sourceforge.net/), a simpler alternative to sooperlooper

Connecting Jack to SooperLooper:

- Open Jack and SooperLooper
- In Jack:
	- Click "Start"
	- Click "Routing"
		- In Send, click system>capture_1, then in Receive double-click sooperlooper>common_in_1
		- In Send, click system>capture_2, then in Receive double-click sooperlooper>common_in_2
		- In Send, click sooperlooper>common_out_1, then in Receive double-click system>playback_1
		- In Send, click sooperlooper>common_out_2, then in Receive double-click system>playback_2
	- Click File>"Save Studio Setup..."
		- Next time, after Clicking "Routing", you can choose File>"Load Studio Setup..."

Next steps:
- Open up Jack and SuperLooper by executing a single command line
- Connect midi controller and implement a few simple controls
	- Might be easier to do this in ubuntu since in osx we need a midi patchbay?
- Open up Jack, SuperLooper, and midi controls by executing a single command line
